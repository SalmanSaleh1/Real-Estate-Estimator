            Our project, titled <strong>Resolving the Real-Estate Negotiation Phase Using Machine Learning to Determine an Accurate Price</strong>, focuses on addressing a critical challenge in the Saudi Arabian real estate marketâ€”accurate property valuation. Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms and Geographic Information System (GIS) integration, our tool is designed to provide precise and reliable price estimates by leveraging historical data from the Ministry of Justice and real-time economic indicators.

        <p>
            The real estate market in Saudi Arabia, driven by ambitious growth plans under Vision 2030, has become increasingly dynamic. Accurate property pricing is vital for buyers, sellers, and financial institutions, yet current tools often lack localization and real-time data, reducing their effectiveness. Our project aims to bridge this gap, offering a user-friendly interface that enhances decision-making and transparency in the market.
